Data Analysis Internship Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Data Analysis Internship. This space serves as a portfolio of the projects, tasks, and analyses I completed during my internship. It includes datasets, code, insights, and documentation relevant to my learning and contributions.

üîç Overview
During this internship, I worked on real-world datasets and performed various tasks related to:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

Data visualization and reporting

Using tools like Python, SQL, Excel/Google Sheets, and Power BI (if applicable)

Each project folder contains a description of the problem, the dataset (if shareable), the analysis performed, and the final insights or conclusions.
